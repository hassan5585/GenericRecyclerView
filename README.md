# GenericRecyclerView
This is a recyclerview with all provided classes that are needed for it to function.

You can use this recyclerview to create a list of objects that can have nested headers and footers. Almost any combination of
list can be made very easily and it does all the heavy lifting for you.

Plus it has convenience functions that handle

1. Inflation of the view
2. Handling headers and subheaders
3. Filtering
4. Sorting

It works with IContent objects(Standard Interface). I hope to add a sample project soon to help show you how to use it.
